Problem Set 3
Please answer the below questions:



"A. Write and share a small note about your choice of system to schedule periodic tasks (such as downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours). 
Why did you choose it? Is it reliable enough; Or will it scale? If not, what are the problems with it? And,
what else would you recommend to fix this problem at scale in production?"

Celery is a solid choice for scheduling periodic tasks due to its reliability, ease of use, and scalability.
By addressing potential concerns and following best practices, it can be effectively used in production to handle tasks of varying complexity and frequency.



"B. In what circumstances would you use Flask instead of Django and vice versa? "

Use Flask:

->For lightweight apps, microservices, or custom solutions.
->When you need flexibility and minimal overhead.

Use Django:

->For full-stack apps with built-in features (admin, ORM, auth).
->When rapid development and scalability are priorities.
